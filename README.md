    Explanation: 

    Step 1. We declare those variables that store the quantity of food items or rooms.
    These variables fill the whole quantity of these food items.
   

    Step2. Now, we declare those variables that will hold the value of the number of food items that have been sold
    
    Step 3: Create some more variables that will create the total price of each of the food items, or the  Total price of items
    

    Step 4: make a list kind of structure of which we will ask the user to enter the number or  
    quantities of food items or rooms that we have in the hotel. 


    After making a choice, we  again want to choose another option. A goto statement here with
    transfers the control to the menu after making the choice. so that we can make more choices. goto 
    is a jump statement, basically, that is going to jump from one part to another part that has enough specified level. We have a level menu of m, and this go to jump statement will help us in jumping to the menu after every choice.
